This class teach how make a RAM using Logic Cells (*p_MEMORY_TYPE = "OWN"*) and also using memory blocks (*p_MEMORY_TYPE = "INTEL"*). 
The INTEL_MEMORY.vhd file was generated by Quartus's graphic resources on the path: 
```
Library > Basic Functions > On Chip Memory > RAM: 1-PORT 
```
The parameter *p_MEMORY_RESOURCE* can assume the following values: "M9K" and "LOGIC". Thus, choosing "M9K" the memory will be modelled using internal blocks, even if we're using the *OWN* memory code aproach.
